What's the difference between the docker commands: run, build, and create

docker build: converts your Dockerfile into an image.
docker create your-image: creates a container from your image, 
docker run your-image: creates & starts the container based on your image.

Here is the difference between image and container:

Image: An image is basically a specified snapshot of your filesystem and includes
the starting command of your container. To create an image you usually create
instructions how to build that image in a Dockerfile. FROM and RUN commands in the docker
file create the file-snapshot. One may build an image from a docker file with docker build <dockerfile>

Container: A container is created by an image. One image may have multiple containers. 
Its file-snapshot is based on the file-snapshot created by the image. 
If you start a container it will run the command you specified in your docker file
CMD and will use part of your memory and cpu. You can start or stop a container.
If you create a container, its not started by default. This means you can't communicate to the
container via ports etc. You have to start it first. 
One may create an container from an image by docker create <image>. 
When a container has been created it shows the id in the terminal. 
One may start it with docker start <container_id>.

Finally docker run image is a shortcut for docker create <image> and docker start <container_id>.

What is Docker Compose?

An application can consist of multiple containers running different services.
It can be tedious to start and manage containers manually, so Docker created 
a useful tool that helps speed up the process - Docker Compose.

Docker Compose is software used for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
It can handle multiple containers simultaneously in the production, staging, development, 
testing, and CI environment. Therefore, use Docker Compose to manage the whole software 
development lifecycle (SDLC).

Docker Compose works by applying rules defined in a docker-compose.yaml file.
The YAML file configures the application's services and includes rules specifying
how you want them to run. With the file in place, you can start, stop, or rebuild all 
the services using a single command. Additionally, you can check the status of a service, 
display log outputs, and run one-off commands.
