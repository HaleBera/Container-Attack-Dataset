For monitoring we used TCPDump and WireShark.
  
 First determine the interface name where the attacker machine realize the attacks:
  
 $ ip route 
   default via 192.168.128.1 dev wlp4s0 proto dhcp metric 20600 


 $ tcpdump -i wlp4s0 -w CVE-2020-17518.pcap port 8081
 
  - "-i": Filter according to the interface to avoid other network packets. (NOTE: If both the attacker and the vulnerable image works in your local, use "lo" instead "wlp4s0" 
 

 $  netstat -antp | grep 31589  // you can list the port usage
